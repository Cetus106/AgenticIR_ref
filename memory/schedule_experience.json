  "distilled": "Based on the collected experience, we can distill the following knowledge to guide the order of tasks for image restoration:\n\n1. **Dark + Noise**: It is slightly better to denoise before brightening (32% total fail rate) than to brighten before denoising (35% total fail rate).\n\n2. **Defocus Blur + Haze**: Defocus deblurring should be done before dehazing, as it results in a lower total fail rate (18% vs. 20%).\n\n3. **Defocus Blur + JPEG Compression Artifact**: Removing JPEG compression artifacts before defocus deblurring leads to a lower total fail rate (20% vs. 28%).\n\n4. **Motion Blur + Dark**: Motion deblurring should be done before brightening, as it results in a lower total fail rate (23% vs. 26%).\n\n5. **Motion Blur + Low Resolution**: Motion deblurring should be done before super-resolution, as it results in a lower total fail rate (16% vs. 19%).\n\n6. **Noise + JPEG Compression Artifact**: The order of denoising and JPEG compression artifact removal does not significantly affect the total fail rate (both 26%).\n\n7. **Rain + Haze**: Deraining should be done before dehazing, as it results in a lower total fail rate (21% vs. 24%).\n\n8. **Rain + Low Resolution**: Deraining should be done before super-resolution, as it results in a significantly lower total fail rate (14% vs. 32%).\n\nFrom these observations, we can infer that generally, it is more effective to address blurring issues (motion blur, defocus blur) before addressing issues related to image content enhancement (super-resolution, brightening, dehazing). Additionally, it is often better to remove artifacts (rain, JPEG compression) before improving the image's content or quality. However, the impact of the order may vary, and in some cases, such as noise and JPEG compression artifact, the order does not significantly affect the outcome. \n\nWhen dealing with more complex degradations, these guidelines can serve as a starting point, but it may be necessary to conduct additional trials to determine the most effective order of tasks."

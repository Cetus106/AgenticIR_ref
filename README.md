## Overview
### Learning from exploration

### Workflow

## Examples
### Restoration of real-world images
Restore a UDC image (from [this work](https://yzhouas.github.io/projects/UDC/udc.html)) by motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and low light enhancement.

Restore an underwater image (from [this work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9001231)) by defocus deblurring, dehazing, and motion deblurring.

## Installation
Please refer to [INSTALL.md](installation/INSTALL.md).

## Usage
### Setup
+ Fill in the API key in `config.yml`.
+ Run `python src/app_eval.py` and `python src/app_comp.py` in the directory `DepictQA`.

### Data preparation
To generate complexly degraded images, run `python -m dataset.synthesize`. You should place clean images in `dataset/HQ/` and corresponding depth maps in `dataset/depth/`. In the paper we use the [MiO100](https://github.com/Xiangtaokong/MiOIR?tab=readme-ov-file#setp-2-download-the-testsets) dataset. The degradation combinations are listed in `dataset/degradations.txt`. You can customize combinations in `dataset/degradations.txt` or degradation types in `dataset/add_single_degradation.py`.

### Learning
To let the agent learn from exploration, run 
+ `python -m exploration.exhaust_seq` to generate images to explore;
+ `python -m exploration.explore` to accumulate experience by evaluating images;
+ `python -m exploration.distill` to summarize the experience and distill knowledge.

### Inference
Run `python -m pipeline.infer` to restore an image (path specified in `pipeline/infer.py`).
